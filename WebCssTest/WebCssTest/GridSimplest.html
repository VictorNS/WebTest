			The hardest part about grids is gutters.
			<br />So far we've made our grid flexible by using percentages for widths.
			<br />We could make the math all complicated and use percentages for gutters as well, but personally
			<br />I don't like percentage gutters anyway, I like fixed pixel size gutters.
			<br />Plus, we're trying to keep too much thinking out of this.
